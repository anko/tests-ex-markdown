# tests-ex-markdown [![npm module](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/tests-ex-markdown.svg?style=flat-square)][1] [![Travis CI test status](https://img.shields.io/travis/anko/tests-ex-markdown.svg?style=flat-square)][2] [![npm dependencies](https://img.shields.io/david/anko/tests-ex-markdown.svg?style=flat-square)][3]

tool for testing your [Markdown][markdown] code examples

 - **language-agnostic** (you can choose what program runs your code examples)
 - **clear diagnostics** (colour diffs, line numbers, stdout, stderr, exit code, â€¦)
 - **hidden** (only requires annotations in HTML comments; the document renders
   the same!)
 - **[TAP][tap-spec] output** (easy to read, compatible with [many other
   tools](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-tap))

# examples

<!-- !test program ./index.ls -->

<!-- !test in example -->

```markdown
# async

The [async][1] library for [Node.js][2] contains functions that abstract over
various asynchronous operations on collections.  For example:

<!-- !test program node -->

<!-- !test in simple example -->

    const async = require('async')
    async.map(
      [1, 2, 3], // Input collection
      (number, callback) => callback(null, number + 1), // Mapper
      (error, value) => console.log(value) // Finish callback
    )

The output is:

<!-- !test out simple example -->

    [ 2, 3, 4 ]

<details><summary>Example: Testing C code with GCC</summary>

<!-- !test in C example -->

You can use whatever you want as the `!test program`:

```markdown
<!-- !test program
cat > /tmp/program.c
gcc /tmp/program.c -o /tmp/test-program && /tmp/test-program -->

<!-- !test in printf -->

    #include <stdio.h>
    int main () {
        printf("%d\n", 42);
    }

<!-- !test out printf -->

    42
```

<!-- !test out C example -->

<details><summary>Example: Replacing <code>require('module-name')</code> with <code>require('./index.js')</code></summary>

Your users are using your library by calling require with its package name
(e.g. `require('module-name')`.  However, it makes sense to actually run tests
on the local implementation at `require('./index.js')`, or whatever is listed
as the `main` file in `package.json`.

So let's just replace those `require` calls before passing it to `node`!

<!-- !test in require replacing example  -->

```markdown
<!-- !test program
# First read stdin into a temporary file
TEMP_FILE="$(mktemp --suffix=js)"
cat > "$TEMP_FILE"

# Read the package name and main file from package.json
PACKAGE_NAME=$(node -e "console.log(require('./package.json').name)")
LOCAL_MAIN_FILE=$(node -e "console.log(require('./package.json').main)")

# Run a version of the input code where requires for the package name are
# replaced with the local file path
cat "$TEMP_FILE" \
| sed -e "s/require('$PACKAGE_NAME')/require('.\\/$LOCAL_MAIN_FILE')/" \
| node
-->

<!-- !test in use library -->

    // In our case, requiring the main file just runs the program
    require('tests-ex-markdown')

<!-- !test out use library -->

    TAP version 13
    1..0
    # no tests
    # For help, see https://github.com/anko/tests-ex-markdown
```

<!-- !test out require replacing example -->

> ```
> TAP version 13
> 1..1
> ok 1 use library
>
> # 1/1 passed
> # OK
> ```

<details><summary>Example: Testing stdout and stderr output in the same code
block</summary>

Prepending `2>&1` to a shell command [redirects][shell-redirection-q] `stderr`
to `stdout`.

<!-- !test in redirect stderr -->

```markdown
<!-- !test program 2>&1 node -->

<!-- !test in print to both stdout and stderr -->

    console.error("This goes to stderr!")
    console.log("This goes to stdout!")

<!-- !test out print to both stdout and stderr -->

    This goes to stderr!
    This goes to stdout!
```

<!-- !test out redirect stderr -->

> ```
> TAP version 13
> 1..1
> ok 1 print to both stdout and stderr
>
> # 1/1 passed
> # OK
> ```

<details><summary>Example: Testing a program with non-zero exit status</summary>

Put `|| true` after the program, and the shell will swallow the exit code.  If
you don't, `txm` assumes all programs that exit non-zero must have
unintentionally failed.

<!-- !test in don't fail on non-zero -->

```markdown
<!-- !test program node || true -->

<!-- !test in don't fail -->

    console.log("Hi before throw!")
    throw new Error("AAAAAA!")

<!-- !test out don't fail -->

    Hi before throw!
```

<!-- !test out don't fail on non-zero -->

> ```
> TAP version 13
> 1..1
> ok 1 don't fail
>
> # 1/1 passed
> # OK
> ```
</details>

<details><summary>Example: Testing examples that call <code>assert</code></summary>

If your example code calls `assert` or such (which throw an error and exit
nonzero when the assert fails), then you don't really need an output block,
because it already documents itself.  In such cases you can use a `!test check`
annotation.

<!-- !test in asserting test -->

```markdown
<!-- !test program node -->

<!-- !test check laws of mathematics -->

    const assert = require('assert')
    assert(1 + 1 == 2)

```

<!-- !test out asserting test -->

> ```
> TAP version 13
> 1..1
> ok 1 laws of mathematics
>
> # 1/1 passed
> # OK
> ```

Example: [This
readme!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anko/tests-ex-markdown/master/readme.markdown)

# usage

## `txm [--jobs <n>] [filename]`

 - `filename`: Input file (default: read `stdin`)
 - `--jobs`: How many tests may run in parallel (default: number of CPU cores)
 - `--backend`: Command to background before first test, killed after last test
   (default: none)
 - `--version`
 - `--help`

`txm` exits `0` *if and only if* all tests pass.

Annotations (inside HTML comments):

 - #### `!test program <program>`

   The `<program>` is run as a shell command for each following matching
   input/output pair.  It gets the input on `stdin`, and is expected to produce
   the output on `stdout`.

   To use the same program for each test, just declare it once.

 - #### `!test in <name>` / `!test out <name>` / `!test err <name>`

   The next code block is read as given input, or expected stdout or stderr.

   These are matched by `<name>`, and may be anywhere.

 - #### `!test check <name>`

   The next code block is read as a check test.  The previously-specified
   program gets this as input, but its output is ignored.  The test passes if
   the program exits `0`.

   Use this for code examples that check their own correctness, (e.g.  by
   calling `assert`), or if your test program is a linter.

Note that 2 consecutive hyphens (`--`) inside HTML comments are [disallowed by
the HTML spec][html-comments-spec].  For this reason, `txm` lets you escape
hyphens: `#-` is automatically replaced by `-`.  If you need to write literally
`#-`, write `##-` instead, and so on.  `#` acts normally everywhere else.
